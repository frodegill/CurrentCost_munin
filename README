CurrentCost_munin is server/client software I have written to be able to show the CurrentCost EnviR monitoring of our house' energy usage in Munin graphs. It depends on libxml2 and ctb (and uses netcat as client)

Installing libxml2 is just a matter of "sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev".

Ctb is a different case:
First, download it from <URL: https://iftools.com/download/ctb/0.16/libctb-0.16.tar.gz >
"gunzip libctb-0.16.tar.gz" to gunzip it.
"tar xf libctb-0.16.tar" to untar it
"cd libctb-0.16/samples/"
add "#include "/usr/include/getopt.h"" at the top of the file ctbtest.cpp to be able to compile later on..
"cd ../build/"
add "-I../include/ctb-0.16/ -I/usr/include/" to CPPFLAGS in the file GNUmakefile
"make -f GNUmakefile DEBUG=0 GPIB=0" to compile it. (And compile it one more time, with DEBUG=1, to be able to debug the application)
"sudo make -f GNUmakefile DEBUG=0 GPIB=0 install" to install it. (And, once more, install it with DEBUG=1 to be able to link a debug version of the application) 
"sudo cp ../include/ctb-0.16/kbhit.h /usr/local/include/ctb-0.16/" to install a header-file the ctb makefile seems to have forgotten..
Finally "sudo ldconfig" to update the cache


To compile CurrentCost server, just type "make && sudo make install". If you already have a server running, do a "sudo /etc/init.d/CurrentCost stop" before compiling, and a "sudo /etc/init.d/CurrentCost start" after.
